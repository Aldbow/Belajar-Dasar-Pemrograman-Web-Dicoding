            One of the best laptops for programming can have a big impact on your working life. If you're a programmer, you'll know the benefit of having a powerful laptop, or if not, the pain of having a sluggish machine. While computer programming or coding doesn't necessarily need the most powerful laptop money can buy, your work probably also involves tasks like complex image editing that do require more powerful hardware.And, of course, testing and running the apps, websites or games you've created, often using emulation, can also be fairly intensive. With this in mind, we've rounded up the best laptops that coders and developers can use for day-to-day work.

            Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.

            Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

              I am Aldiva Wibowo, a Computer Science Student in Medan State University. I have a dream to become a doctor in the future. but I did not pass the test so I was very confused to continue my studies to college. but then i find in YouTube that Programming stuff very intresting, from that i study again to test again for Computer Science and i did it. I want to master the Web Programming so that I can Create a very complex website
